The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit that works to improve the security of software
online. Annually they release a list of the top 10 most common web application vulnerabilities to be mindful of
both as a tester and as a developer. Familiarity with the vulnerabilities that make this list is a crucial part
of being an effective bug hunter whether you are on a red-team assessment or chasing bug bounties.<br>

OWASP also maintain an open-source project called the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop)
which is home to all of these common vulnerabilities and some extra both for training and demonstration purposes.
Normally with web applications, I like to use Burp Suite, but in the spirit of OWASP, I'll be following along with
[OWASP Zap](https://www.zaproxy.org/) which is their free and open source Burp Suite competitor.<br>

I'm going to go through each item on the [OWASP Top Ten 2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and try exploit 
the ones available to me on the OWASP Juice Shop.<br>

# A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

Broken Access Control describes a vulnerability where a user is able to access or change resources they should not
have permissions to be accessing or changing. For example, accessing another user's basket in the OWASP Juice Shop.<br>

Firstly, we need to understand how we access our own basket before finding out if we can access someone else's.
Create an account with on the Juice Shop, put something in your basket and click on `Your Basket` in the top right.

![Basket](js_basket.png "My Basket")
_My Basket_

Everything is normal, I put the Fruit Press in my basket, I clicked my basket and here it is. Now we can go to our
history tab in Zap or Burp to see the request that was sent to view my basket:<br>
`GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/rest/basket/6`<br>
It looks like `6` must be my account ID. What would happen if we knocked that `6` down to a `5`? Would we get another
user's basket? To find out we can enable request interception in Zap and modify that ID to match `5` instead of our
destined `6`.

![ID=5](js_modifyid.png "ID=5")
_/basket/5_

As you can see from the screenshot, I have modified the ID and we can send it on using the blue arrow underlined
above.

_A01:2021 - Broken Access Control_

There it is, we have successfully accessed another user's basket.

# A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic Failures describes a vulnerability where secrets can be accessed by users as a result of weak 
cryptography. For example, encoding secrets instead of encrypting them or using weak hashing algorithms such as MD5.
The Juice Shop doesn't have a whole lot of challenges in relation to this topic so the one I have chosen to demonstrate
is forging a coupon.<br>

In `/ftp`, there are two files of current interest: `coupons_2013.md.bak` and `package.json.bak`. Trying to access
these files regularly will result in a 403, however you can access them by adding `%2500.md` to the end of the request
which is simply just URL-encoded `%00`.<br>

`coupons_2013.md.bak` contains:<br>
```
n<MibgC7sn
mNYS#gC7sn
o*IVigC7sn
k#pDlgC7sn
o*I]pgC7sn
n(XRvgC7sn
n(XLtgC7sn
k#*AfgC7sn
q:<IqgC7sn
pEw8ogC7sn
pes[BgC7sn
l}6D$gC7ss
```
Which currently isn't much good. Inside `package.json.bak` is a list of dependencies used by the Juice Shop, among
them is a dependency called `z85` running version `0.0`. Searching for `z85` reveals that it is an encoding algorithm.
Assuming the contents of `coupons_2013.md.bak` are encoded using `z85`, we can reverse the encoding to find out the
contents. Downloading [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/z85-cli), we can successfully do this.<br>
`z85 --decode "n<MibgC7sn"` returns `JAN13-10`<br>
`z85 --decode "mNYS#gC7sn"` returns `FEB13-10`<br>
We now know what format the coupons are issued in, now we can modify a valid coupon found at [@owasp_juiceshop](https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop/status/1520578742807977984).
Writing this, the current valid coupon is `o*I]qga+mn`.<br>
`z85 --decode "o*I]qga+mn"` returns `MAY22-20`<br>
We can now modify this to give us a much better discount:<br>
`z85 --encode "MAY22-90"` returns `o*I]qga+Hu`<br>
This is now a forged, currently valid 90% off discount coupon.

# A03:2021 - Injection

Injection describes a vulnerability where user-supplied data is not validated, filtered or sanitized by the application.
One of the most common and devastating kinds of injection would be SQL Injection. SQL Injection is a vulnerability
where that user-supplied data is included unsanitized in a SQL query. For example, when logging in to the Juice Shop,
the server will take your email and password and throw it into a SQL query to find your account in the database.<br>
An example query might look like:<br>
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'slimicide@juice-shop.com' AND password = '123'`<br>
In this instance, the email and password are user-supplied data. Since the query is unsanitized, we can simply cut the
query short and bypass the need for a password. If we wanted to take over the admin account and we don't have a password,
we can simply submit our login email as `admin@juice-sh.op'--`<br>

`'` closes the query field and `--` is a comment in SQL. This results in the part of the query asking for a password to be
commented out leaving the final query to look like:<br>
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@juice-sh.op'`-\-' AND password = '123'<br>

This of course, will return the admin user.

# A04:2021 - Insecure Design

Insecure Design is a very broad category and one that is hard to define in terms of the Juice Shop.
Insecure Design is more so a thought saying "Well that's probably not a good idea" rather than a concrete
definition of a vulnerability. For example, having the `/ftp` directory available on the Juice Shop from earlier definitely
fits this description. It's not a vulnerability in itself but relying on 403s to keep unauthorized parties out of sensitive
documents probably isn't secure design, especially when those documents aren't required at all by the application and
also because we can bypass the 403 with little to no effort.

---
# A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

Security Misconfiguration describes a vulnerability in which a web application has some controls inaccurately
configured or left insecure. For example, applications with default credentials enabled or a file upload filter bypass.
For our Juice Shop example, we have a challenge called `Deprecated Interface` where we are told we can use a B2B interface
that was not properly shut down.<br>

In order to find remnants of old features, we can look to the site's complaint page. They allow uploads of `.zip` and
`.pdf` files. In `main.js` we can find the upload functionality:
```js
this.uploader = new kt.bA({
            url: './file-upload',
            authToken: `Bearer ${ localStorage.getItem('token') }`,
            allowedMimeType: [
              'application/pdf',
              'application/xml',
              'text/xml',
              'application/zip',
              'application/x-zip-compressed',
              'multipart/x-zip'
            ],
            maxFileSize: 100000
          }),
```
The upload dialogue box shows only `.pdf` and `.zip` are supported, however looking at `main.js`, `.xml` is also
supported despite the dialogue box not showing it. We can make a quick harmless `.xml` file and upload it to 
`/#/complain`

# A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Nothing ambiguous about this title. Out of date software has vulnerabilities, using it makes you vulnerable.
We have a list of dependencies from earlier in `/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md`. We can simply search for them in
[Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/).<br>

`sanitize-html` <= 1.4.3 does not recursively sanitize input, making it vulnerable to XSS.

---
# A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

Identification and Authentication Failures describes a class of vulnerability involving weak authentication or 
poor session management. Examples include: weak passwords, session hijacking and insecure password recovery mechanisms.
For the Juice Shop, we're going to reset Bender's password. The Juice Shop's password recovery process involves
security questions with knowledge-based answers that people other than the account holder could know. It's probably
safe to assume Bender is referencing the robot from Futurama. His security question is:<br>

`Company you first work for as an adult?`<br>

A quick Google search reveals the answer is `Stop'n'Drop` and we successfully reset Bender's password. Had an email
been sent to `bender@juice-sh.op` to reset his password, we would probably have a significantly tougher time.

# A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

Software and Data Integrity Failures refers to a class of vulnerabilities that are introduced to a system through
plugins, libraries or modules from untrusted sources. Insecure Deserialization is also included in there.
As I have just found out, the `Insecure Deserialization` challenges aren't available on the Juice Shop when running
it in a Docker container like I am so I cannot demonstrate this one.

---
# A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures refers to the failure of a web application to collect any meaningful logs
about activity happening on the application. The Juice Shop's logs are publicly exposed at `/support/logs` and we can
take a look inside to see what information is being collected. These logs don't reveal anything beyond successful requests
to server resources. They collect the resource accessed and the user-agent. They don't log important events such as
unsuccessful/successful logins, active scanning or password resets.

---
# A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery

Server-Side Request Forgery is a vulnerability in which the server can be tricked into making web requests for you, typically
to access resources only available to the server. SSRF is a personal favorite of mine and is incredibly annoying to pull 
off on the Juice Shop. Thankfully, I have a write-up of one of my favorite HackTheBox machines `Forge` listed [here](https://slimicide.github.io/posts/HackTheBox-Forge/).
`Forge` required a lot of playing around with SSRF to complete the `User` section of the box and is a much more detailed
look at the vulnerability than I could have done on the Juice Shop. That write-up is also home to the Mona Lisa of MS-Paint diagrams.
